# Innoslate Adapter

## Running the script

1. Create a .env in the root directory of the adapter, and model it after the .env-sample. The Deep Lynx container environment variable is the destination container that the script will extract requirements nodes from.
2. `npm install`
3. Run `ts-node` in the root directory
